This repo contains: <br/>
- Resources folder: containing the crypto market csv file used for the analysis.
- Jupyter notebook file containing the analysis where the best 'k' value was found using the elbow curve method. This k value was then used to fit the K-means model to the original scaled data as well as the to the PCA data. The clusters were then compared.
